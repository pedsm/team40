\section{Lecture 1}
\subsection{Introduction}
The first lecture was them comparing OO to our previous knowledge of C. They also introduced a couple of concepts which i'll go over. Since most of the exam relies on understanding what object orientation is, i'll try my best to give a proper overview/understanding on the topic in this section; so this will probably be the longest section but the most important one.
