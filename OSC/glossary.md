## File systems
 - Disks:
 	- Cylinders: Collection of tracks
	- Tracks: Concentric circle on single side
	- Sectors: Segment of a track
 - Cylinder Skew: an offset added to sector 0
 - Access time = seek time + rotational delay + transfer time
 - Seek time = Ts = n x m + s
  	- n = number of Tracks
	- m = crossing time per track
	- s start-up delay
 - Average rotational latency = half of disk rotation time
 - Transfer time: tt = b/N x ms per minute/rpm (data transferred per rotation)
 - Disk scheduling:
 	- FCFS
	- Shortest seek time first
	- (SCAN) Lift algorithm: Zig zags up and down
	- C-Scan; Up(reading) and straight down.
	- Look scan:
 - User views: define abstractions
 - Implementation view: define low level Implementation
 - In UNIX
	 - Character special files: used for IO devices such as keyboards and printers
	 - Block special files: Hard drives
 - File control blocks: only accessible on Kernel mode
 - Directed acyclic graph (DAG): Allow file sharing cycles are forbidden
 	- Dag allows for file sharing(aliases)
 	- Cycles can generate infinite loops
	- Removing files is complicated(links must be removed as well) : Garbage collection is required
 - Generic graph structure: Cycles are allowed here
 - Fat(file allocation table)
 - Log structured file systems(Inodes are next to their data this means that it is contiguous and faster to be read by a spinning hard drive)
 	- Require a cleaner thread
